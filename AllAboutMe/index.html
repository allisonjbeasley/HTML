        All About Me
    </h1>

    <h2>
        My name is Allison Beasley
    </h2>


    <h3>
        Academics
    </h3>

    <p>
        <b><u>My Year:</u></b> Freshman
    </p>

    <p>
        <b><u>My Major:</u></b> Graphic Design and Software Engineering
    </p>
    <p>
        <b><u>My Classes This Semester:</u></b> I'm taking a lot of art classes. I am taking a 2D Design class,
        a drawing class, a basic Honors program class, and this class.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b><u>My Coding Experience:</u></b> I took an intro to tech class my Junior year of high school
        where I learned basic HTML, CSS, and Python. We also programmed some Arduinos. My Senior year
        I took AP Computer Science where I learned Java, so between that and my math credits I am actually
        farther along on my Computer Science degree than my Art degree which is why I am taking so many art
        classes.
